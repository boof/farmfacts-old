FarmFacts - Ruby on Rails based CMS
===================================

Minimal CMS based on Ruby on Rails 2.3+. It uses some plugins I wrote or
refactored myself. The CMS provides some base functionality like page creation
with attachments, authentication and embedable navigations, and can be
extended with engines written for FarmFacts (Blog, Forum, ...).
The CMS supports themes while every page can be handwritten.

FEATURED PLUGINS:
-----------------

* column\_scope - as the name says
* action\_sequence - design forms with multiple steps
* shadows - presenter pattern made easy
* acts\_as\_list - fork without the legacy stuff

PLATFORMS (TESTED):
-------------------

* Mac OS X 10.5, Apache2 (mod\_passenger) and PostgreSQL & SQLite3
* Debian 4.0, Apache2 (mod\_passenger) and PostgreSQL

AUDIENCE:
